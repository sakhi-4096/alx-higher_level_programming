# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples 
Python provides a variety of useful built-in data structures, such as lists, sets, and dictionaries. For the most part, the use of structures is straightforward. The most fundamental sequence type is the list mutable and mixed-type. Tuples are 'immutable lists' but that is short selling. Tuples do double-duty: they can be used as immutable lists and also as records with no field names.
