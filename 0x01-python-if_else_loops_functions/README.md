# Python - if/else, loops, functions
Programming often involves examining a set of conditions and deciding which action to take based on those conditions. Python's if statement allows you examine the current state of a program and respond appropriately to that state.

1 - The last digit
 * This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.
 * You can find the source code here
 * The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
 * You don’t have to understand what import, random.randint do. Please do not touch this code. This line should not change: number = random.randint(-10000, 10000)
 * The output of the program should be:
	* The string Last digit of, followed by
	* the number, followed by
	* the string is, followed by the last digit of number, followed by
	* if the last digit is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
	* if the last digit is 0: the string and is 0
	* if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
	* followed by a new line
2 - I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
 * Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
 * You can only use one print function with string format
 * You can only use one loop in your code
 * You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
 * You are not allowed to import any module
3 - When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
 * Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
 * Print all the letters except q and e
 * You can only use one print function with string format
 * You can only use one loop in your code
 * You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
 * You are not allowed to import any module
