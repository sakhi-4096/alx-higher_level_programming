# SQL Introduction
Structured Query Language, it is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.

## Description
 * SQL provides a standardized way to communicate with and interact with databases, allowing users to perform various operations such as querying data, inserting, updating, and deleting records, creating and modifying database schemas, and more.

 * SQL is used to define, manipulate, and retrieve data in a relational database management system (RDBMS). Some of the common RDBMS systems that use SQL include MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, and more.

## Features
 * **Data Definition Language (DDL):** DDL statements are used to define the structure of the database, including creating tables, altering tables, and defining constraints.
 * **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** DML statements are used to manipulate data within the database. This includes operations like inserting, updating, and deleting records.
 * **Data Query Language (DQL):** DQL statements are used to query and retrieve data from the database. The most common DQL statement is the SELECT statement.
 * **Data Control Language (DCL):** DCL statements are used to control access and permissions on the database objects. This includes granting and revoking privileges to users and roles.
 * **Transaction Control Language (TCL):** TCL statements are used to manage transactions within the database, allowing you to commit or roll back changes.

## Usage
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales'
ORDER BY last_name;
```
