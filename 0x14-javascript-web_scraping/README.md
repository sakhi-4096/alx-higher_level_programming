## Description
JavaScript web scraping refers to the process of using JavaScript to extract, parse, and manipulate data from websites or web pages. It involves making HTTP requests to a web page, retrieving its HTML content, and then using JavaScript code to extract specific information or elements from the HTML, such as text, links, images, or other structured data. Please note that web scraping should be done in compliance with the website's terms of service and policies, and it's important to be respectful of the website's data and bandwidth. Additionally, websites may have protections or security measures in place to prevent web scraping, so it's essential to ensure your scraping activities are legal and ethical.

## Features
 * **HTTP Requests:** JavaScript allows you to send HTTP requests to web servers to retrieve web page content. You can use methods like fetch or libraries like axios to perform GET and POST requests.
 * **Parsing HTML:** JavaScript can parse and manipulate HTML content, making it possible to extract specific data or elements from web pages.
 * **DOM Manipulation:** JavaScript can interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page, enabling you to traverse and manipulate the structure and content of a web page.
 * **Asynchronous Programming:** Web scraping often involves asynchronous operations such as making HTTP requests. JavaScript offers features like Promises and async/await to manage asynchronous tasks efficiently.
 * **Selectors:** JavaScript allows you to use CSS-style selectors to target and extract specific elements from a web page, making it easier to retrieve the data you need.
 * **Data Extraction:** JavaScript can extract data from web pages in various formats, such as text, HTML, JSON, or XML. You can then process and store this data as needed
