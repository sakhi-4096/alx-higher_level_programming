# JavaScript - Warm up
 * It is a high-level, dynamically typed, and interpreted language that provides interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites and web applications.

## Description
 * JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language primarily used for front-end web development but also utilized for various other applications, including server-side development, mobile app development, and more. JavaScript is an essential component of modern web development, playing a crucial role in creating responsive and interactive web applications. It works in conjunction with HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to build engaging user interfaces on the web.

## Features
 * **Client-Side Scripting:** JavaScript is mainly used in web browsers to enhance the functionality and interactivity of web pages. It can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to modify the content and structure of web pages dynamically.
 * **Versatility:** JavaScript can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple form validation and animations to complex single-page applications (SPAs) and server-side programming using technologies like Node.js.
 * **Dynamic Typing:** JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning variable types are determined at runtime. This allows for flexibility but requires careful coding to avoid unexpected behavior.
 * **Event-Driven:** JavaScript is event-driven, meaning it can respond to user interactions (e.g., mouse clicks, keyboard inputs) and execute code in response to these events.
 * **Cross-Platform:** JavaScript runs in web browsers on various operating systems and devices, making it a cross-platform language. Additionally, with Node.js, it can be used for server-side development, further expanding its reach.
 * **Ecosystem:** JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js for building user interfaces, as well as tools and packages available through npm (Node Package Manager).
 * **Syntax Similarities:** JavaScript's syntax is similar to other C-style languages like C++, Java, and C#. This makes it accessible to developers familiar with those languages.
 * **Interoperability:** JavaScript can interact with HTML and CSS to create dynamic web content. It can also communicate with server-side technologies through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

## Usage
```js
/* Sample code adhering to Semi-Standard style */

const greet = (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
};

function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];

for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
  console.log(fruits[i]);
}

const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
};

if (person.age >= 18) {
  console.log(`${person.name} is an adult.`);
} else {
  console.log(`${person.name} is a minor.`);
}

/* Using template literals for string interpolation */
console.log(`The sum of 5 and 3 is: ${calculateSum(5, 3)}`);

/* Function call with semicolon after it (allowed by Semi-Standard) */
greet('Alice');

```
